# Omarchy Config

This repository contains my personalized **Omarchy configuration**, including themes, layout tweaks, and custom settings to enhance the look and feel of Omarchy.

✨ The goal of this setup is to maintain a **clean, consistent, and stylish UI**, with **pink accent colors 🎀** and improved usability through custom OSDs (volume, brightness, etc.).

Feel free to use this repository as a base and customize it to your own workflow.

---

## 📁 Included

- **Theme files** — custom colors and visual style
- **OSD tweaks** — volume, brightness, and other on-screen displays matching the theme
- **Configs** — organized Omarchy configuration files
- **Waybar / Walker / Wlogout** — themed UI components

---

## 🛠 Installation

If you want to use this configuration in your own Omarchy setup:

### 1️⃣ Backup your current Omarchy config (optional)

```bash
mv ~/.config/omarchy ~/.config/omarchy.backup
